This project took me a while to come up with a relevant 
problem domain, and took me about 3 hours to complete.  I am not 100% 
that is correct but will refactor if it is not.  I learned that having a 
vague problem domain is difficult to work with. To solve it I had to dig
deep and find something I could use and realized I was listening to music
and found a way to incorporate it into a problem domain. Resources I used
were the demo code and looked at other student pull requests for examples of
implementation.
