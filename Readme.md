## Lab 5
	- This took me 4 hours to complete.
	- I struggled with implementing virtual methods. I ended up overriding some and not overriding another, since they're optional.
	- I learned how to incorporate encapsulation by using access modifiers. I also learned about polymorphism and using abstract/virtual methods.
    - I utilized the class demos and my previous labs.
